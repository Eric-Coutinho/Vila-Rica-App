# TODO List for Configuring Routes and Home Screen

- [x] Create basic Home component in screens/Home.tsx with placeholder content
- [x] Remove expo-router plugin from app.json to avoid conflicts
- [x] Change package.json main entry to index.js
- [x] Create index.js to register App.tsx as root component
- [x] Configure routes in App.tsx with NavigationContainer (restored navbar by removing headerShown: false)
- [x] Run the app with cache clear to test routing (Expo restarted on port 8081)
